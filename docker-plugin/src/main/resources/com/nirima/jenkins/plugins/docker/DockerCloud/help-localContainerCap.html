<div>
    <p>The maximum number of <b>containers</b> that <i>this Jenkins instance</i> is allowed to run on the docker (value is independent of the template/image).</p>
    <p>Note that containers, which have <b>not</b> been created by Jenkins, are <b>not</b> counted by this limit.</p>
    <p>Default value is 2147483647 (the maximal number of containers this plugin may run at a time) 
    which practically disables it by default (compatibility to earlier versions of this plugin).</p> 
    <p>If set to zero, no containers will be provisioned at all.</p>
