    <p>Allows to disable the usage of this docker cloud entirely.</p>
    <p>Only if the checkbox is selected, new requests to provision
    a container on the docker server will be processed. If the selection is removed,
    all requests to provision containers will be ignored.</p>
    <p>Note that this may lead to not processing your jobs. Jobs which are not
    processed will be queued by the Jenkins server.</p>
